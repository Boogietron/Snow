## Initial_snowflake_2_

This is the initial starting stage for my snowflake design.

## New_snow

I have changes the background colour to clearly show the snowflake and have added some functions to the original code to add an extra snowflake to the design, but the positioning is of.

## snow_2

I have changed the background colour and have added function to add three snowflakes (correctly positioned) shown diagonally.

## New_snowww

I have added a rotation function. When mouse is pressed the shapes that make up the snowflake are rotated multiple times to create an alternate shape.

## Flowers

Based off the snowflake code I have experimented with editing out one of the existing code to create different shapes. 
As seen in the image above I have changed the background and have also changed the shape to show a flower design to represent the season spring.

## Sun

Also on the basis of the initial snowflake code I have changed and experimented with editing out code to show a sun shape. I have also changed the background to present a sky and the yellow colour of the shape used to appear as the sun for the season summer.
